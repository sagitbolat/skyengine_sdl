* [ ] Add a way to have multiple layers on a tilemap (i.e. layer some tiles that have transparancy on top of other tiles)
* [ ] Add collider information to tilemaps and a way of defining them in the editor.
    * [ ] Line colliders that take up one or two sides of a tile (two for angles).
        * [ ] One-way line colliders that block collision from one side but not another
        * [ ] Twoway line colliders that block collision from both sides
    * [ ] Tile colliders that act like a normal box collider but for the whole tile.
