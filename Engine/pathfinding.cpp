// NOTE: A* algorithm that takes a 2D array of ints (0 for walkable tiles, 1 for unwalkable tiles), a current position of an object, a destination position.

// NOTE: Same as previous method but the 2D array of ints can be non binary values. The ints represent the weight of movement to the tile. ie a tile of value 6 is weighted 6 to move to.
