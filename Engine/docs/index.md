# SkyEngine User Manual
Skyengine is meant as a general-purpose, low-level, 2D game engine. 

It acts as an abstraction layer for the programmer over a number of existing APIs such as OpenGL, OpenAL, and SDL. 

This manual is meant to help you learn how to use the engine. You can read if from start to finish, or use it as a reference.

If it is your first time using the SkyEngine, refer to the Getting Started guide.
